## Step 1: Install Python
If you haven't already, you need to install Python on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: Python Downloads. During installation, make sure to check the option to add Python to PATH.

## Step 2: Open Command Prompt or Terminal
After installing Python, open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).

## Step 3: Navigate to the Directory
Navigate to the directory where you saved the "snapbot by ohsunset.py" script using the cd command. For example, if the script is located on your desktop, you would use: cd Desktop

## Step 4: Install Required Packages
In the command prompt or terminal, run the following command to install the required Python packages (pyautogui, keyboard, and tkinter):pip install pyautogui keyboard tkinter
This command will download and install the necessary packages for the script to work.

## Step 5: Run the Script
Once the required packages are installed, you can run the script. Enter the following command:python "snapbot.py"
This command will execute the Python script.

## Step 6: Use the Bot
After running the script, you will see the GUI (Graphical User Interface) for the auto clicker. You can use the provided buttons to record click positions, start/stop the auto clicker, stop it manually using the 'D' key, clear recorded positions, and visit the creator's YouTube channel.

## Step 7: Close the Script
To close the script, you can simply close the window of the GUI application, or you can press Ctrl + C in the command prompt or terminal window where the script is running.
